*Fast Q & A for the most asked Questions** 
(Q) How do i install the mod
(A) just download the release and drop everything where the wilds.exe is located
(Q) Does the mod work in 0.8.X
(A) **YES!** this mod works on any version of wilds that is on 0.8.X
(Q) Is there other mons added in the mod
(A) **YES** all cut content mons are added in
(Q) How do i install the mod
(A) Please look at the videos on the github for the answer
(Q) Will there be a 0.9
(A) We plan on leaving the 0.8 version up and making a separate version for 0.9 this for reasons that is listed further below
(Q) Why will there be two versions?
(A) 1. the whole UI has been changed 2. most of the textures have been renamed 3. the folder order has been changed. this completely breaks the mod and i am a archivist so i will allow the options for people play my mod on 0.8 and others can still use the 0.9 version
(Q) What will be in 0.9
(A) Animated Tiles, Custom Biomes, Added mons from 1-9? and regional variants, more items, retextured ow sprites, take my word for it, it will again push the limits of wilds just as 0.8 mod has done before hopefully 0.9 will allow external scripts
(Q) When will the 0.9 be out
(A) Probs Q2-3 when Wilds goes to 0.9 though it might be 2 weeks after 0.9 release unless the devs allow us to have a private early access of 0.9 then we can release the mod on the day 0.9 comes out witch is what i wish to happen but its really up to them
