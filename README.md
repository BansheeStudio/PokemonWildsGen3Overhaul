Thank you for the FR/LG edits, edits to savanna tiles as well as  Deep Desert/Snow tile edits, 
and some of the other tiles in the pack. They really do help blend it and replace some of Hoenn's less detailed tiles 
as well as the optional edits for fans of FR/LG. Also for Porting sounds and music from the gen 3 games.
